Uncertainty Quantification
===========================

This folder contains tutorials for uncertainty quantification with Push.

- `Uncertainty Quantification`_ provides background information and defitions for model and data uncertainty.
- `Test Time Augmentation`_ is a basic tutorial for running test time augmentation on MNIST with Push.
- `Bootstrapping`_ is a basic tutorial for running bootstrapping on a toy dataset with Push.
- `Prior Networks`_ is a basic tutorial for running prior networks on a toy dataset with Push.
- `Domain Uncertainty`_ is a basic tutorial for quantifying in-domain and out-domain uncertainty on a toy dataset with Push.
